# RNA_Complimentarity
Displays complimentary sequence and  supporting stability data for an input RNA strand. Useful for miRNA or siRNA sequence identification for long novel RNA substrates.
This code utilizes the same framework as the DNA_Complimentarity repo with modifications to the nucleotide mappings to reflect accurate RNA nucleotides and exlusion of irrelevant biochemical parameters for ssRNA (like H-Bond count)
